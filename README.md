# Protostrap - a prototyping framework for designers

This framework is **for designers** that want to get klickable and testable prototypes up fast. It is based on Bootstrap, so all you can do there you can do here too.

With just **very** basic knowledge of php it allows to make page elements reusable on different pages - useful for reusing navigation and recurring elements.

This is, as yet, experimental. have fun but be warned.
_Do *not* use this in a production environment._
