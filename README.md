# Protostrap - a prototyping framework for designers

This framework is _for designers_ that want to get klickable and testable prototypes up fast. It is based on Bootstrap, so all you can do there you can do here too.

With just _very_ basic knowledge of php it allows to make page elements reusable on different pages - useful for reusing navigation and recurring elements.

This is, as yet, experimental. have fun but be warned.
_Do *not* use this in a production environment._

# Requirements
- A local webserver with any version of PHP (Designers: Macs are shipped with one)


## Usage
- Download Protostrap
- _put it on your local server, if you have a MAC /Library/WebServer/Documents is the Folder you're looking for_
- you can access it in the browser via: http://localhost/protostrap assuming you have named the folder protostrap and put it into the above directory.
