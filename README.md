# Protostrap - a prototyping framework for designers

This framework is **for designers** that want to get klickable and testable prototypes up fast. It is based on Bootstrap, so all you can do there you can do here too.

With just **very** basic knowledge of php it allows to make page elements reusable on different pages - useful for reusing navigation and recurring elements.

This is, as yet, experimental      .

This is prototyping software and therefore lacks all security features needed for production
### Do NOT use this in a production environment

# Requirements
- A local webserver with any version of PHP.
**Mac Users with OS X Lion or older:** Macs come shipped with a webserver enabled by default, it is situated under /Library/WebServer/Documents.
